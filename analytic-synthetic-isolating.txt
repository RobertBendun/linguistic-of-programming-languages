= Analitic, isolating and synthetic languages

Analitic languages uses specific grammatical words, rather then inflection to express syntatic relations in a sentance.
Subcategory of analitic languages are isolating languages - languages where there is no word inflection at all.
Synthetic languages are opposition to isolating languages - words are composition of multiple morphemes.

Almost all programming languages are isolating. One of exceptions is https://www.concatenative.org/wiki/view/Deque[Deque] programming language which attaches `!` as either prefix or suffix to indicate on which end of double-ended queue operation must be performed.

Allow me to present the deque language that I just made up.

1! - Pushes a one to the right of the deque

!1 - Pushes a one to the leftt of the deque


add! - Adds the right two numbers of the deque

!add - Adds the left two numbers of the deque

...

3! !5 !2 sub! !add

If applied to an empty deque this will leave the value 4 on the deque.
